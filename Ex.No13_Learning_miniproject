### AIM: 
To write a program to train the classifier for -----------------.
###  Algorithm:

### Program:
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

```
# loading the dataset to a Pandas DataFrame
credit_card_data = pd.read_csv('/content/credit_data.csv')
```



### Output:


### Result:
Thus the system was trained successfully and the prediction was carried out.
