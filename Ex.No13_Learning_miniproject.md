### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221220058
### AIM: 
To write a program to train the classifier for Credit Card Fraud Detection.
###  Algorithm:
1. Gather a dataset containing historical credit card transactions.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values impute or remove missing data.
Scale numerical features: standardize numerical features to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Initialize the logistic regression model with appropriate parameters (e.g., regularization term) and 
train the model using the training dataset
5. Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset.
Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score to assess the model's performance.
6. Once the model is trained and evaluated, use it to predict the likelihood of fraud for new transactions.


### Program:
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

```
# loading the dataset to a Pandas DataFrame
credit_card_data = pd.read_csv('/content/credit_data.csv')
```
```
# first 5 rows of the dataset
credit_card_data.head()

```

```
credit_card_data.tail()
# dataset informations
credit_card_data.info()
# checking the number of missing values in each column
credit_card_data.isnull().sum()
```

```
# distribution of legit transactions & fraudulent transactions
credit_card_data['Class'].value_counts()

```

This Dataset is highly unblanced

0 --> Normal Transaction

1 --> fraudulent transaction
```
# separating the data for analysis
legit = credit_card_data[credit_card_data.Class == 0]
fraud = credit_card_data[credit_card_data.Class == 1]
print(legit.shape)
print(fraud.shape)
```
(284315, 31)
(492, 31)
```
legit.Amount.describe()
fraud.Amount.describe()
# compare the values for both transactions
credit_card_data.groupby('Class').mean()
```
Under-Sampling

Build a sample dataset containing similar distribution of normal transactions and Fraudulent Transactions

Number of Fraudulent Transactions --> 492
```
legit_sample = legit.sample(n=492)
new_dataset = pd.concat([legit_sample, fraud], axis=0)
new_dataset.head()
new_dataset.tail()
new_dataset['Class'].value_counts()


new_dataset.groupby('Class').mean()

```

Splitting the data into Features & Targets
```
X = new_dataset.drop(columns='Class', axis=1)
Y = new_dataset['Class']
```
Split the data into Training data & Testing Data
```
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, stratify=Y, random_state=2)
print(X.shape, X_train.shape, X_test.shape)
```

Model Training
Logistic Regression

```
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```
Model Evaluation
Accuracy Score
```
X_train_prediction = model.predict(X_train)
training_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_train_prediction, Y_train)
print('Accuracy on Training data : ', training_data_accuracy)
```
Accuracy on Training data :  0.9415501905972046
```
# accuracy on test data
X_test_prediction = model.predict(X_test)
test_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_test_prediction, Y_test)
print('Accuracy score on Test Data : ', test_data_accuracy)
```



### Output:
```

X_test_prediction = model.predict(X_test)
test_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_test_prediction, Y_test)

print('Accuracy score on Test Data : ', test_data_accuracy)
```

### Result:
Thus the system was trained successfully and the prediction was carried out.
